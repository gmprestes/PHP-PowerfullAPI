# PowerfullAPI 
An powerful and very light-weight PHP REST API

* Very easy to set up and get going, you just need to copy PowerfullAPI files into your working directory.
* Independent from other libraries and frameworks.
* Supports HTTP authentication.

Support the following formats :
* text/plain
* text/html
* application/json
* application/xml

# Installation
Just put files .htaccess and PowerfulAPI.php into directory that you'd like to work with API and enjoy it :)

# Configuration
You need tell to PowerfullAPI where are your controller files (wherever they are). For this, edit api.php and add your controller's classes like in this sample:

```php
<?php

require 'PowerfulAPI.php';
require 'controllers/TestController.php';
require 'Test2Controller.php';

$server = new PowerfulAPI();

$server->addClass('TestController');
$server->addClass('Test2Controller');
$server->handle();
```
# Routing
Is too easy to add routes and they are informed in controllers adding @url documentation tag 

You need tell to Powerful API what are your routes (whatever you need). To do this, add a @url documentation tag on your methods to tell for Powerful API what routes are allowed for this method, like in the sample:

* Adding a GET route to /home
```php
    /**
     * @url GET /home
     */
    public function test()
    {
        return "Home API";
    }
```

* Adding a GET route with variable ($id) to /home/1
Variable name can be whatever you want
```php
    /**
     * @url GET /home/$id
     */
    public function home($id)
    {
        return $id;
    }
```

* Adding a POST route to /home/save
```php
    /**
     * @url POST /home/save
     * @noAuth
     */
    public function save($data)
    {
        $arg = $data->arg;
        $arg2 = $data->arg2;
        // TO DO
        //Save data
    }
```

You can get all posted data in the special variable $data. It's too easy.

If you try access a method that not exist, API will return 404 - Not Found response.

# Authentication

By default, authentication is disabled, but you can enable it adding a method named authorize to your controller. All requests will call that method first. If authorize() returns false, the server will issue a 401 Unauthorized response. If authorize() returns true, the request continues on to call the correct controller action. All actions will run authorize() first, unless you add @noAuth in the action's docs (I usually put it above the @url mappings).

```php
    /**
     * @url POST /home/save
     * @noAuth     <---------------- No authentication flag
     */
    public function save($data)
    {
       // CODE
    }
```

To help you more, in .htaccess file, you can see this line :
```php
RewriteRule .? - [E=Authorization:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
```

This line add the tag Authorization to your $_SERVER global variable, so you can send this autorization tag in an JQuery ajax request 

```javascript

$.ajax({
        type: "GET",
        contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
        dataType: "json",
        url: '/api/getsomedata',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Basic ' + YOUR_AUTENTICATION_TOKEN,
        },
      data: { // CODE }
    }).done(function (msg) {
        // CODE
    });

```

and get it in Autorize() on server 

```php

    function authorize()
    {
        if (isset($_SERVER["Authorization"]))
          return true;
        else
          return false;
    }

```

PS.: Inside your authentication method you can use PHP's getallheaders function or $_COOKIE depending on how you want to authorize your users.
